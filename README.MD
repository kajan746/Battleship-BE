# Welcomme to Battleship app

Hi there!

These are the basic instructions that needs to be done in the project setup

## Configuring the database

For this project we have used MongoDB. So make sure your system has mongoDB.

Create a database in the name of 'battleship'

Go to 'index.ts' file which is in the 'src' folder

On the line no 12 you can change the port if you want. By default it runs on the port 3000. Since we are running the react project, we cannot use port no 3000. So use 3001.

On the line no 15 change your database name.  For the current project it is 'battleship'.
If there is any change in the database host, please change the url in the same project.

### Build the project

Run `npm run build` command to build the project.

#### Start the project

Run `npm start` to start the project
